	<h1>EVERY AND THEN SOME</h1>
	<p>Arrays also come wtih the standar methods EVERY and SOME.Both take a redicate function that, when called with an aarray element as argument, returns true of false. Just like "&&" returns a true value only when the expressionsn on both sides are true, EVERY returns true only when the predicate returns true for ALL elements of the array. Similarly, SOME returns true as soon as the predicate returns true for ANY of the elements. They don't process more elements than necessary-for example, if SOME finds thath the predicate holds for the first element of the array, it will not look at the values after that.</p>
	<p>Write two functiosn EVERY and SOME, that behave like these methods, excep that they take the array as their first argument rather than bein a method.</p>
