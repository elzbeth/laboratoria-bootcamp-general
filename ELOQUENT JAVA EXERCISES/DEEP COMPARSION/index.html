	<h1>DEEP COMPARSION </h1>
	<p>Write a function DEEPEQUAL, that takes two values and returns true only if they are the same value or are objects with the same properties shose values are so equal when compared with a recursive call to DEEPEQUAL. </p>
	<p>
	To find out whether to compare two things by identity (use the === operator for that) or by lookin at their properties, you can use the TYPEOF operator. If it produces "OBJECT" for both values, yoou should do a deep comparson. But you have to take one silly exceptions into account: by historical accident, TYPEOF NULL also produces "object"
