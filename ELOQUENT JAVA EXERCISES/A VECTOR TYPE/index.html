	<h1>A VECTOR TYPE</h1>
	<p>Write a constructor VECTOR that represents a vector in two-dimensional space. It takes "x" and "y" parameters(numbers), which it should save to properties of the same name.</p>
	<p>Give the VECTOR prototype two methods, PLUS and MINUS, that take another vector as parameter and return a new vector that has the sum or difference of the two vectors'(the hone in THISand the parameter) x and y values.</p>
	<p>Add a getter property LENGTH to the prototype that computes the length of the vector- that is, the distance of the point (x,y) from the origin (0,0).
