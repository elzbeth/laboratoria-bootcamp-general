	<h1>REVERSING AN ARRAY</h1>
	<p>Arrays have a method REVERSE, which changes the array by inverting the order in which its elements appear. For this exercise, write two funcios, REVERSEARRAY and REVERSEARRAYINPLACE. </p>
	<p>
	The first, REVERSEARRAY, takes any array as argument and produces a NEW array that has the same elements in the inverse order. The second, REVERSEARRAYINPLACE, does what the reverse method does: it modifies the array given as argument in order to reverse its elements. Neither may use the standard REVERSE method.
	</p>
	<p>
	Thinking back to the notes about side effects and pure functions, which variant do you expect to be useful in more situations? Which one is more efficient?
