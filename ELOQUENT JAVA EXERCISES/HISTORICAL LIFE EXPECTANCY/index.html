	<h1>HISTORICAL LIFE EXPECTANCY</h1>
	<p>When we looked up all the people in our data set that lived more than 90 years, only the latest generation in the data came out. Let's take a closer look at that phenomenon.</p>
	<p>Compute and output the average age of the people in the ancestry data set per century. A person is assigned to a century by taking their year of death, dividing it by 100, and rounding it up, as in Math.ceil(person.died/100)</p>
	<p>For bonus points write a function GROUPBY that abstracts the grouping operation. It should accept as arguments an array and a function thaht computes the group for an element in the array and returns and object that maps group names to arrays of group members.</p>
