	<h1>A LIST</h1>
	<p>Objects, as generic blob of values, can be used to build all sorts of data structures. A common data structures is the LIST(not to be confused with the array). A list is a nested set of objects, with the first object holding a reference to the second, the second to the third, and so on. A nice thing about list is that they can share parts of their structure. </p>
	<p>
	Write a function ARRAYTOLIST that builds up a data structure when given [1,2,3] as argument, and write a LISTTOARRAY function that produces an array from a list. Also write the helper functions PREPEND which takes an element and a list and creates a new list and a number and returns the element at the given position in the list, or UNDEFINED when there is no such element.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you haven't already, also write a recursive version of nth.
