	<h1>SEQUENCE INTERFACE</h1>
	<p>Design an interface that abstracts iteration over a collection of alues. An object that provides this interface represents a sequence, and the interface must somehow make it possible for code thaht uses such an object to iterate over the sequence, looking at the element values it si made up of having some way to find out when the end of the sequence is reached.</p>
	<p>When you have specified your interface, try to write a function LOGFIVE that takes a sequence objec and calls CONSOLE.LOG on its first five elements of fewer, if the sequence has fewer than five elements.
	</p>
	<p>The implement an object type ARRAYSEQ that wraps an array and allows iteration over the array usin the interface you designed.Implement another object type RANGESEQ that iterates over a range of integers (taking FROM and TO arguments to its constructor)instead.</p>
