	<h1>RECURSION</h1>
	<p>We've seen that %(the remainder operator) can be used to test wheter a number is ever or odd by using %2 to check whether it's divisible by two. Here's another way to define wheter a positive whole number is ever or odd:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Zero is even</li>
		<li>One is odd</li>
		<li>For any other number N, its evennes is the same as N-2</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a number parameter and return a Boolean.	
	</p>
	<p>
	Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?
