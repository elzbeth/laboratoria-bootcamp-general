	<h1>BEAN COUNTING</h1>
	<p>You can get the Nth charater, or letter, form a string by writing "string".chartAt(N). The returned value will be a string containing, only one character.</p>
	<p>
	Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase "B" characters are in the string.
	</p>
	<p>
	Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercse "B" characters). Rewrite countBs to make uste of this new function.
